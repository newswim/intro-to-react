```notes
I looked for images about React's popularity,
but there hundreds of annecdotes and semi-reliable data out there.
State of JS is probably the most trusted. (Along with Stack Overflow)
```

```notes
The DOM has long had its detractors
```
#### DOM = Document Object Model

<Appear>
  <blockquote>"The DOM is a mess[!]"</blockquote>
  <cite>John Resig, creator of jQuery</cite>
  <blockquote>"The browser is the worst API ever."</blockquote>
  <cite>Douglas Crockford</cite>
</Appear>

---
```notes
There are plenty of ways to manually change the DOM
jQuery gives some fairly friendly tools, but anyone who's built
a large enough application, knows the pains of trying to maintain
all of the non-reusable code.
```
## "Vanilla" web development
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- _The DOM_ (good luck.)

---
```notes
Prior to React, a lot of frameworks were Template-based
Templates encourage a poor separation of concerns
```
## Other solutions
- Angular 1
- Traditional MVC

These are typically very "bulky" (lots of concepts) and opinionated.

---
# Where does React fit in all of this?

---

<blockquote>
  Itâ€™s true that React is only a UI library.
  It doesnâ€™t prescribe routing, state management, data fetching or even language choice
</blockquote>
<cite>â€“ John Hannah, Why is React More Popular Than Angular?</cite>

---

## Brief history

- Really a library, but sure, "framework"
- Introduced in 2013
![](../assets/rethinking.png)
- A **reaction** to trends
- Can be **incrementally adopted**

---
```notes
If you watch that talk, you'll hear a lot about..
Decoupling - the degree to which each program module relies on each of the other modules - wikipedia
Cohesion - 
```
## Key Terms :: Separation of concerns
- `Coupling` - The degree to which each program module relies on each of the other modules.
- `Cohesion` - The degree to which elements of a module belong together
- (wikipedia)

---
# Back then, web apps were pretty messy..

---
```notes
- This is BackBone.js
- calling render() overwrites everything
- whatever was in <textarea>
- wanted to only update the random number <span>:
```

```js
var HomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: _.template('<h1>Hello World!</h1>' +
    '<p>Random number: <span><%- number %></span> (click for another)</p>' +
    '<textarea>Notes...</textarea>'),
  events: {
    'click p': 'render'
  },
  randomNumber: function() {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
  },
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.template({
      number: this.randomNumber()
    }));
  }
});
```

---
```notes
- Manual DOM manipulation performs poorly
- Code everything twice - once in the template, and once again updating the DOM (jQuery)
- Component dependencies are opaque
- Hard to reason about component interactions
```
## And had some other problems...

- Updates to DOM were manual and imperative
- Coded everything twice
- Unclear module dependency
- Not easy to reason about
- Not easy to test

---
```notes
- Someone else made a list of more problems
- This is true for more than just Backbone
```

## Complaints (continued...)
- Lots of boilerplate
- Longer development time
- Need to have comprehensive understanding to build large projects 
- Difficult to organize/structure code
- Memory leak issues

---
#### When something goes wrong..

## You hit "refresh" over and over.

---
# React attempts to resolve all of these problems.

---
### (âœ‹ hang on...)

# ES6 Crash Course

---

- Stands for `E[cma]S[ript]6`
- Rolled out in 2015
- Since then, JavaScript has seen yearly updates
- We often use
  <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>
  /<a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> for compilation and bundling

---
```notes
Class
- Just syntactic suger for prototype inheritence
- Has additional things like private methods which we won't cover
```
### ES6 brings much ðŸ”¥
- `let` and `const` (block-scoped variables)
- `class` == `Object` with a `constructor` function
- \+ you don't need `,` between methods
- \+ `this` depends on how it's called
- `=>` == `function () {}` with `this` auto-bound

---
## A few more keywords

```jsx
import   // modules (based on CommonJS)
export   // ...
...      // rest/spread operator
```

---
```notes
React uses these new languages features to provide a declarative component structure and API
```

### (âœ… Resume presentation)

# How does React do it?

---
```notes
An example component with its own state and updater function
```
```jsx
const randomNumber = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1

class HomeView extends React.Component {
  state = { randomNum: randomNumber() }
  newNumber = () => this.setState({ randomNum: randomNumber() })
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p onClick={this.newNumber}>
          Random number: {this.state.randomNum} (click for another)
        </p>
        <textarea>Notes...</textarea>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

---
```notes
- TextArea is an example of an "uncontrolled" component, which we'll talk about later
```
```
Here is the actual component being rendered:
```
<HomeView />

---
```notes
React "renders" to the DOM by selecting an html node at the "Root" element
```

## You can render anywhere in the existing DOM

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

const root = document.getElementById('some-element');
ReactDOM.render(<HomeView />, root);
```

---
```notes
Let's give a counter example
(A joke!)
```

# A simple counter example

---
```notes
Important parts:
- State
- Extends (ES6)
- Click handlers
- Event listeners
- render
We're going to gloss over what React is doing when you fire an event.
```

<Counter />

```jsx
class Counter extends Component {
  state = {
    count: 0
  }

  handleClick = () => this.setState({ count: state.count + 1 })

  render() (<button onClick={this.handleClick}>Higher</button>)
  }
}
```

---
## Differences with HTML
- `onClick` rather than `onclick`
- `className` rather than `class`
- `htmlFor` rather than `for`

---
### React Concepts
- One-way data flow
- Consistency: the same input / same output
- Lightweight, reusable components
- Don't mutate, simply re-render
- (virtual DOM â†’ super fast)


---
## Unidirectional Data Flow

![](../assets/one-way.svg)


---
```notes
More concepts we'll quickly cover
```

## *!important*

- JSX
- Props and State
- `setState`
- Lifecycle hooks
- class vs. functional components

---
# JSX

- XML if you squint
- Declarative
- Separates concerns rather than technologies
- Compiles to regular JavaScript

```jsx
const LoggedOutPage = () => dom('a', {href: '/login'}, 'Please log in!');
const LoggedOutPage = () => (<a href="/login">Please log in!</a>);
```

```notes
Stop on Slide 65
```
## Summary of Virtual DOM
- Maintains a "copy" of the DOM
- Only changes where necessary
- [Reconcilliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)

---
# Props and State

- https://benjie.github.io/react-technical-intro/#105


---
## Controlled vs Uncontrolled

- Uncontrolled simply means that React will handle the state updates of the component.
- Otherwise, it's up to you (eg. "Controlled")


---
# Events / controlled components

#### Lifecycle hooks

```notes
A common way that people start introducing React to their workflow is to replace
one piece of UI logic with a React component.
```
### Incremental adoption is huge

- Build a single React component for your existing website.

---
## ðŸ’¯ Fantastic tooling
- `create-react-app`
- Material-UI // Ant Design
- thousands of packages on NPM

---
## Things we didn't cover:
- Styling
- Event bubbling/pooling
- Context API
- Fiber
- New lifecycle hooks

---
