```notes
I looked for images about React's popularity,
but there hundreds of annecdotes and semi-reliable data out there.
State of JS is probably the most trusted. (Along with Stack Overflow)
```

- He makes a fantastic product, `PostGraphile`
- Check it out if you are interested in using GraphQL along with Postgres
- It's amazing.

# What is React?

---

<blockquote>
  Itâ€™s true that React is only a UI library.
  It doesnâ€™t prescribe routing, state management, data fetching or even language choice
</blockquote>
<cite>â€“ Why is React More Popular Than Angular?, John Hannah</cite>

---

## A brief history

- Introduced in 2013
- Really a library, but sure, "framework"
- "Re-thinking best practices"
- Can be "incrementally adopted"

---

# Back then, web apps were pretty messy..

---
```notes
- This is BackBone.js
- calling render() overwrites everything
- whatever was in <textarea>
- wanted to only update the random number <span>:
```

```js
var HomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: _.template('<h1>Hello World!</h1>' +
    '<p>Random number: <span><%- number %></span> (click for another)</p>' +
    '<textarea>Notes...</textarea>'),
  events: {
    'click p': 'render'
  },
  randomNumber: function() {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
  },
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.template({
      number: this.randomNumber()
    }));
  }
});
```

---

## And had some problems...

- Manual DOM manipulation performs poorly
- Code everything twice - once in the template, and once again updating the DOM (jQuery)
- Component dependencies are opaque
- Difficult to test
- Difficult to reason about component interactions

---
```notes
- Someone else made a list of more problems
- This is true for more than just Backbone
```

## Complaints (continued...)
- Lots of boilerplate code necessary 
- Longer development time needed 
- Need to have comprehensive understanding to build large projects 
- Difficult to organize/structure code 
- Memory leak issues 

---
#### When something goes wrong..

## You hit "refresh" over and over.

# (âœ‹ hang on...)

## ES6 Crash Course

---
### ES6 brings much ðŸ”¥
- `let` and `const` (block-scoped variables)
- `class` == `Object` with a `constructor` function
- \+ you don't need `,` between methods
- \+ `this` depends on how it's called
- `=>` == `function () {}` with `this` auto-bound

---
```notes
React uses these new languages features to provide a declarative component structure and API
```

### (âœ… Resume presentation)

# React is different.

---

```jsx
const randomNumber = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1
class HomeView extends React.Component {
  state = { randomNumber: randomNumber() }
  newNumber = () => this.setState({ randomNumber: randomNumber() })
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p onClick={this.newNumber}>
          Random number: {this.state.randomNumber} (click for another)
        </p>
        <textarea>Notes...</textarea>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

---
```notes
- TextArea is an example of an "uncontrolled" component, which we'll talk about later
```
```
Here is the actual component being rendered:
```
<HomeView />

---
```notes
React "renders" to the DOM by selecting an html node at the "Root" element
```

## Render anywhere in the existing DOM

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

const root = document.getElementById('root');
ReactDOM.render(<HomeView />, root);
```

---
```notes
A common way that people start introducing React to their workflow is to replace
one piece of UI logic with a React component.
```

### Incremental adoption is huge

- Build a single React component for your existing website.

---
```notes
The important concepts we'll go over
```

## *#important*

- JSX
- Props
- setState
- Lifecycle hooks
- Unidirectional data flow
- class vs. functional components


---
```notes
Class
- Just syntactic suger for prototype inheritence
- Has additional things like private methods which we won't cover

Arrow
- Lambda shorthand
- Auto-binding
```

### E(cma)S(ript)6 Syntax

```jsx
import   // modules (based on CommonJS)
export   // ...
class    // sugar
=>       // lambdas
...      // rest/spread operator
```

---

# JSX

- XML-like
- "Declarative"
- Turns into regular JavaScript

```jsx
<IsThisXML answer="???" />
```

---

## Controlled vs Uncontrolled

- Uncontrolled simply means that React will handle the state updates of the component.
- Otherwise, it's up to you (eg. "Controlled")

---
```notes
Let's give a counter example
(A joke!)
```

# A counter example

---
```notes
Important parts:
- State
- Extends (ES6)
- Click handlers
- Event listeners
- render
We're going to gloss over what React is doing when you fire an event.
```

<Counter />

```jsx
class Counter extends Component {
  state = {
    count: 0
  }

  handleClick = () => this.setState({ count: state.count + 1 })

  render() (<button onClick={this.handleClick}>Higher</button>)
  }
}
```
